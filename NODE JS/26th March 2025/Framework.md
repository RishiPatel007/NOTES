A framework is like a structure that provides a base for the application development process. With the help of a framework, you can avoid writing everything from scratch. Frameworks provide a set of tools and elements that help in the speedy development process. It acts like a template that can be used and even modified to meet the project requirements.

A **library** performs specific, well-defined operations.

A framework is a skeleton where the application defines "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton . The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application

# Advantages

- Easy to test your code and debug it.
- Clean code .
- Reduces redundancy of code .
- Features and functionalities provided by the framework can be modified and extended.

# Disadvantages

- Steep learning curve .
- Less flexibility and design choices.
- Performance overhead as it loads unnecessary things .
